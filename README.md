# Baddie-game-javascript
A very simple game you can open in a browser. This was a school exercise on Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola for the course Javascript1


Since this was a school exercise there are a lot of commented areas within the code including some tips how to solve it, i decided to leave them be and not remove them.

The game is playable with the arrow keys to move, and space bar to jump. The goal is to get to the door.

The baddie game is also published online and you can check it out by clicking the following link:
